	<h2>About</h2>
	  <p>I am an incoming PhD student at University of Missouri, Columbia in the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I will be persuing my research under the guidance of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/raopraveen/home" target="_blank">Dr. Praveen Rao</a> in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/raopraveen/sds-lab" target="_blank">Scalable Data Science (SDS) lab</a>. The research focus of this lab is to develop scalable algorithms, techniques, and systems for gaining insights from massive datasets in domains such as ecommerce, social media, healthcare, and defense applications. This demands new innovations in data and knowledge management, information retrieval, and machine learning. The lab has expertise in big data and scalable/cluster computing technologies. It also focuses on applications of machine learning and deep learning techniques to solve challenging problems in cybersecurity (e.g., on social media), healthcare (e.g., digital pathology, precision health), and sustainable design. </p>
